# War
This is a text - based simulation of the card game war. 
the rules are as follows:
-- the deck is split between players.
-- each player draws a card.
-- the player that deals the highest value card the round and all the cards on the table subsequently go to them.
-- if 2 of the players with the highest value card have a draw , they have to go "War"
-- each player draws 5 cards each and the player with the higher value card wins.
-- this is repeated until all but one player runs out of cards or there is not enough cards for the last but one player to go to war.
